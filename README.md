## Overview

I've created this very basic and limited SDK "Structure" for my own needs. It is available for anyone who would like to expand upon it.

*I am not affiliated with Vinli.*

## Requirements

You need a vinli adapter and developer account. Meineke is the distributor and has co branded the car dongle as Revvy. Order here http://www.meineke.com/revvy/
